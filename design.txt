## Design Reflections

- Most of my game properties of the data models were similar to the Guess a Number example. However, I did have to add
a few things to enable my Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game to work. First, I added a percentage property so I could
track each user's win loss ratio. Accordingly, I also added win and loss properties in order to continuously tally the
total wins and total games played. Since many of my endpoints used the UserForm, I removed much. of the scoreForm
functionality from the example.

- Initially, I struggled with implementing some of the score functionality as used in the example. My game, Rock Paper
Scissors Lizard Spock, is fundamentally different from the guess a number so I chose to use the UserForms for both high
scores and rankings by percentage. This made more sense, given the design of my application, because each game is only
played once and each action can be attributed to a user. Lastly, my game logic was extremely involved given the extra
complexity beyond the traditional rock paper scissors game. It helped me to physically write down and chart a table of
each possible selection, what the selections beats, and what it is beat by. This helped me to more easily and
efficiently create the game logic in my api.py file when I was ready.
